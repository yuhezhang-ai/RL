"""A NeMo-RL-owned HTTP router in front of the vLLM generation fleet.

NeMo-Gym picks a policy endpoint by static round-robin over a list fixed at process
start, with no health input and no failover. A dead vLLM endpoint therefore keeps
receiving roughly 1/N of new rollouts for the rest of the run, and Gym retries a refused
connection in an uncapped loop with no HTTP timeout.

Rather than change Gym, hand it a single URL that NeMo-RL owns. Gym's
``VLLMModelConfig.base_url`` accepts one string, so its round-robin becomes a no-op and
the routing decision moves here, next to the fleet health that already knows which shards
are serving.

Two properties make this safe to put in Gym's critical path:

* **The URL never changes.** The port is reserved once and passed in, so Ray recreating a
  restarted actor rebinds the same address. Gym is never reconfigured and never has to
  fail over -- which matters because failing over is exactly what it cannot do.
* **Every piece of state is built in __init__.** A restarted actor is immediately usable.
  This is the deliberate inverse of the NemoGym mistake, where the servers were started
  from a separate ``_spinup`` that Ray never re-runs.

Deliberately *not* a redirect. Handing Gym a 307 would put its socket back on a vLLM
endpoint directly, so a backend dying mid-request would drop it into the same uncapped
retry loop this exists to avoid.

One thing this trades away: Gym's selection is *sticky* round-robin -- a session keeps its
backend -- so per-request least-outstanding gives up prefix-cache affinity across the
turns of a multi-turn rollout. That is a real cost, not purely a defect being fixed, and
it is worth measuring before enabling this on a multi-turn workload.
