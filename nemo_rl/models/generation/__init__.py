    """Let the raylet reap a dead generation worker's EngineCore, on runs the driver owns.

    A vLLM generation worker spawns its EngineCore as a plain multiprocessing child --
    ``context.Process(target=EngineCoreProc.run_engine_core)``, no ``setsid``, not a
    daemon -- and that child owns the CUDA context and the KV cache. Every cleanup path
    that exists runs INSIDE the dying process, so SIGKILL defeats all of them: vLLM's
    ``weakref.finalize`` never fires, a non-daemon multiprocessing child is designed to
    outlive its parent, and Ray's default ``RAY_kill_child_processes_on_worker_exit`` is
    the worker's own exit handler. The orphan then holds its GPU for the life of the job:
    measured on 4xGB200, one SIGKILLed shard left 114.95 GiB of a 184.31 GiB device still
    held, and it did not come back across five restart attempts -- the replacement could
    not fit, so re-admission failed while the survivors carried on. Because the EngineCore
    never calls ``setsid`` it stays in the worker's process group, which is exactly what
    per-worker process-group cleanup reaches.

    **The raylet is the only reader, and this only reaches the raylet on runs where the
    driver starts it.** Ray reads ``process_group_cleanup_enabled`` in the raylet, at the
    raylet's own startup. Call this **before** ``init_ray()``, like
    :func:`~nemo_rl.data_plane.factory.maybe_configure_data_plane_env`, and on a
    local/single-node run ``ray.init`` forks a raylet that inherits this environment, so it
    lands. On a Slurm or k8s cluster it does NOT: ``ray start`` has already run on every
    node before the driver process exists, and ``init_ray()`` then attaches to it with
    ``address="auto"``. Nothing the driver sets afterwards can change a raylet that is
    already up. Those deployments set the flag where the raylet is actually launched --
    see the ``RAY_process_group_cleanup_enabled`` export in ``ray.sub`` -- which means it
    is unconditional there, not scoped to fleet health.

    So the gate below buys scoping on exactly one deployment shape. It is still worth
    having: a raylet-wide behaviour change should not follow from ``import nemo_rl``, and a
    plain SFT, DPO or distillation run has no EngineCore to reap. But it is not a property
    of the flag, it is a property of who started the raylet.

    ``setdefault``, not assignment: an operator debugging a wedged engine may want the
    corpse, and an explicit ``RAY_process_group_cleanup_enabled=0`` stays honoured.

    Args:
        enabled: Whether this run can lose a generation worker and keep going. A ``bool``
            rather than the fleet-health config, so any entrypoint that builds vLLM
            generation can call it -- the leak is not specific to fleet health, it just
            takes a run that survives the loss to leave the orphan behind. Note this is
            ``fleet_health.enabled``, not ``restart_dead_shards``: any shard loss leaks
            that GPU, restarting is only what makes the loss survivable.
