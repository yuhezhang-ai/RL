    """Patch vLLM's Ray executor env propagation and worker runtime_env.

    1. Pass custom runtime_env in _init_workers_ray call (file patch).
        - This allows passing custom py_executable to worker initialization.
    2. Forward extra env vars to the Ray workers via vLLM's additive
       VLLM_RAY_EXTRA_ENV_VARS_TO_COPY hook (vLLM >= 0.25). NCCL_*, HF_*, and
       HUGGING_FACE_* vars are already copied by vLLM's default prefix list
       (this includes the NCCL_CUMEM_ENABLE/NCCL_NVLS_ENABLE workaround from
       https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/pull/898).

    .. note::
        Step 1 patches the **v1 Ray executor**, which vLLM 0.25 no longer
        selects by default: ``VLLM_USE_RAY_V2_EXECUTOR_BACKEND`` flipped from
        ``"0"`` (0.20) to ``"1"`` (0.25), so ``Executor.get_class`` returns
        ``RayExecutorV2`` for ray-backed engines. ``RayExecutorV2`` has no
        ``_init_workers_ray`` at all -- it creates workers inline, and its
        ``_build_runtime_env`` never sets ``py_executable``.

        The patch is kept because it is still load-bearing when
        ``VLLM_USE_RAY_V2_EXECUTOR_BACKEND=0`` selects the v1 executor. Under
        the 0.25 default it is inert, and workers get the right interpreter
        from Ray's per-field ``runtime_env`` inheritance instead: the parent
        NeMo-RL actor sets ``py_executable``, and a child created with a
        ``runtime_env`` that omits it inherits the parent's value.

        So a ``True`` return means "the anchor is in place", not "this is what
        put the workers on the right interpreter". The caller logs
        accordingly.

    Returns:
        Whether the v1 runtime_env source patch is in place. The env-var merge
        in step 2 cannot fail, but step 1 is anchored on a call-site string; if
        that moves upstream the py_executable injection silently stops
        happening, so the caller must not report success unconditionally.

def _patch_vllm_ray_executor_v2_tcpstore_port(logger) -> None:
    """Keep RayExecutorV2's TCPStore port out of the MessageQueue's scan range.

    vLLM 0.25's ``RayExecutorV2._init_executor`` picks the torch.distributed
    TCPStore port with a bind-probe (Step 3) but only binds it much later, in
    the rank-0 worker's ``init_process_group``. In between, Step 4 builds the
    broadcast ``MessageQueue``; when the engine spans nodes that queue needs a
    real TCP socket, so it calls ``get_open_port()`` and *binds and holds* the
    result (``shm_broadcast.py``: ``remote_subscribe_port = get_open_port()``
    then ``remote_socket.bind(...)``). Both searches start at ``VLLM_PORT``, so
    the queue deterministically takes the very port the probe just released and
    engine startup dies with ``EADDRINUSE`` (DeepSeek-V3 generation TP=32,
    observed on port 7000). Engines that fit on one node use a shm/ipc socket
    instead and never allocate a TCP port here, which is why only node-spanning
    engines are affected.

    Offsetting the TCPStore search past the queue's scan range removes the
    collision while keeping both ports inside the engine's 100-port window, and
    therefore below the OS ephemeral floor. That band is deliberate: leaving
    ``VLLM_PORT`` unset would send vLLM to kernel-assigned ephemeral ports and
    reintroduce the TOCTOU contention this layout exists to prevent (#2380,
    #3103).

    The offset must be applied *before* the ``local_dp_rank is None`` test, not
    inside it. vLLM's own disjoint-window branch below reads as if it only
    applies to DP engines, but ``ParallelConfig.__post_init__`` takes the
    "offline SPMD" path for every engine NeMo-RL builds and assigns
    ``data_parallel_rank_local = envs.VLLM_DP_RANK_LOCAL`` (0 by default) and
    ``data_parallel_master_port = envs.VLLM_DP_MASTER_PORT`` (0 by default). So
    a plain non-DP engine arrives here with ``local_dp_rank=0``, not ``None``:
    the ``None`` branch is dead, and the DP branch searches from
    ``0 + 100 + 0 * 32 = 100``, fails all 32 attempts on the privileged range,
    and falls through to ``get_open_port()`` — straight back to ``VLLM_PORT``.
    That is exactly the port the MessageQueue takes. See RL-1104.

    Returns without raising when the snippet is missing, but logs at warning
    level so a silent no-op is visible in worker logs.

    """Make MessageQueue's remote socket survive losing a port race.

    ``MessageQueue.__init__`` picks the port for its remote (TCP) socket with
    ``remote_subscribe_port = get_open_port()``, which *probes a port and
    releases it*, and only binds it with ZMQ several statements later
    (``shm_broadcast.py``: ``self.remote_socket.bind(socket_addr)``). The
    window between the probe and the bind is a TOCTOU race.

    On vLLM 0.25 that race is lost reliably, not occasionally. Every
    ``RayWorkerProc`` on a **non-driver** node takes ``n_local_reader=0``
    (``ray_executor_v2.py::_init_message_queues``), so every one of them needs
    a real TCP port, and they all scan from the same ``VLLM_PORT`` -- 7000 for
    a node-spanning engine. ``_init_message_queues`` runs immediately after
    ``init_device()``, whose process-group setup is a collective barrier, so
    all workers on the node arrive at the probe within microseconds of each
    other, all see the same port free, and all but one die with::

        zmq.error.ZMQError: Address already in use (addr='tcp://10.65.1.9:7000')

    Workers on the driver node take ``n_local_reader=1`` and use an ``ipc://``
    socket instead, which is why only node-spanning engines are affected --
    and why no nightly test catches it (none runs an engine whose
    ``tensor_parallel_size * pipeline_parallel_size`` exceeds
    ``cluster.gpus_per_node``). See RL-1111.

    Fix the race at the bind rather than the probe: retry, advancing past the
    port that was lost. This is safe and terminating because a port a peer
    already holds with ZMQ *is* visible to the next ``_get_open_port`` probe
    (a plain ``bind(("", port))`` on it fails with ``EADDRINUSE``), so each
    retry makes forward progress.

    Deliberately keeps the search anchored at ``VLLM_PORT`` instead of letting
    vLLM fall back to ``bind(("", 0))``: kernel-assigned ephemeral ports are
    exactly the TOCTOU contention the reserved sub-ephemeral band exists to
    prevent (#2380, #3103).

    Patching the bind (rather than handing each worker a private start port)
    also covers every other ``MessageQueue`` with a remote reader -- notably
    the executor's own ``rpc_broadcast_mq`` -- instead of the one call site
    that happens to be failing today.
