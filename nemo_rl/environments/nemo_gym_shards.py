"""Schema for splitting one NeMo-Gym stack across several actors.

A single ``NemoGym`` actor runs every environment in the job on one node, which
caps a run at what that node can host. Sharding partitions the Gym config into
groups that each get their own actor on their own node.

NeMo RL composes shard configs; it never interprets them. Everything forwarded
into a shard's merge is opaque Gym config, and validation compares entry
*names*, never meanings.
