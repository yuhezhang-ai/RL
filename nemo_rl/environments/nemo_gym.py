        actor's event loop and no rollout could issue its first HTTP request
        until its own copy finished loading.

        The cost is not marginal. A tokenizer of this shape measured 7.45 MB on

        SingleController recipe admitting ~1000 prompts per step spends roughly

        should take minutes. Runs on that shape stalled without completing a

        153 of 1024 prompts finished in 300 s passing the tokenizer per call,

        """Build the token-free RolloutReceipt payload from a ledger manifest.

        ``terminal_response_id`` is the served response envelope id the
        harness reports for the completion it kept (Gym's
        ``terminal_response_id`` result key), forwarded to ``resolve_terminal``
        as ``declared_response_id``. It is not the logical-request header.

        Terminal selection is staged, fail-closed at every stage:

        1. Witness attribution (``resolve_terminal``): the declared response
           id (``terminal_response_id``), the scored response's
           envelope id, and its content fingerprints each independently name
           a manifest row through ``CallRecord.response_id`` and the recorded
           fingerprints. Agreeing witnesses attribute; a declared id that
           matches no row masks and never falls back; disagreeing witnesses
           attribute nothing.
        2. Heuristic fallback (``select_terminal_call``): with no witness,
           the manifest's explicit parent links infer the terminal
           (fail-closed: ambiguity masks).

        The receipt records the resolving stage in ``terminal_selection``
        (``declared``/``response_id``/``content``/``heuristic`` — failed
        selections stamp the last stage attempted) and the witness trail in
        ``terminal_attribution_reason``. Retry duplicates are dead-branch
        rows: they stay in the manifest (their staged rows are fetched,
        verified, and cleaned) but never join the terminal chain —
        ``verify_and_linearize`` tolerates rows unreferenced by the terminal
        chain.

        Poisoning is fail-closed with one carve-out. A failure row whose
        reason is ``request_finished_without_staged_coordinates`` is a call
        that never returned a completion (the ledger commit precedes the
        response leaving the server) and can never be a lineage parent (an
        uncommitted call has no row to resolve against) — e.g. the doomed
        final call of a rollout that exhausted the model's context window.
        Such rows are structurally off-chain and do not poison; if the
        *terminal* request itself died this way, the missing-terminal-row
        check below still masks the rollout. Every other failure reason
        (``worker_capture_failed``, ``invalid_worker_commit_coordinates``)
        marks a call whose completion WAS served — a hole in the chain —
        and poisons.
