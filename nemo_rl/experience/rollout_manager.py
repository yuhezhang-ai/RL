    Any Ray-boundary error is infrastructure *here*, by context. An exception raised

    arrives as a bare ``RayTaskError`` whose cause the boundary degraded, so
    ``classify_rollout_failure`` can only fall through to DATA and the prompt gets two
    attempts instead of the five the fleet-failure path is built for.

    Scoped to this call site rather than widened in ``classify_rollout_failure``,
    deliberately. Globally, "unrecognized means DATA" is the right default: it is about
    exceptions we can inspect and do not recognize, and flipping it would retry genuine
    bugs everywhere. Here we have information the classifier does not -- this exception
    came from a *generation* RPC, so "that shard could not serve it" is the correct
    reading whatever the destroyed cause was, and re-dispatching to another shard is
    exactly the right response. A real bug in the worker still surfaces, chained, once
    the bounded infra budget runs out.

    This also makes the two paths agree: part 2/4's ``_generate_on_shard`` already maps
    ``ray.exceptions.RayError`` to ``GenerationUnavailable``, so without this the same
    exception classified INFRA there and DATA here.

        No prompt is discarded for infrastructure reasons. An infra failure means the
        fleet is unwell, not the prompt, so the attempt is retried -- and because each
        retry re-enters generation-shard selection, it naturally lands somewhere else
        without this method needing to know anything about shard health. Exhausting the
        infra budget therefore means the failure follows the prompt across the whole
        fleet, which is reported as fleet-wide failure rather than absorbed.

        Deterministic failures get their own, much smaller budget: another shard would
        reject the prompt identically, so retrying mostly burns time. One retry is still
        worth taking because a shard under memory pressure can return an empty
        generation that looks deterministic and is not.

        Args:
            input_sample: A single prompt (one DatumSpec entry).
            target_step: Training step this rollout targets; stamped on the buffer slot for StalenessSampler.force_in_order.
            inflight_registry: Optional controller-owned mapping from group ID to
                its dispatch task and start weight version.
            lineage_group_id: Stable group minted by the rollout ledger before
                dataloader dispatch. TQ records this same ID rather than minting one.
                ``None`` preserves the ordinary non-checkpointed fresh-ID retry path.

        Returns:
            ``COMMITTED`` when the group reached the buffer, or ``SKIPPED`` when the
            prompt was given up on within a budget: its data budget within
            ``max_skipped_prompts``, or its infra budget within
            ``max_consecutive_dropped_prompts``. A ``SKIPPED`` prompt committed nothing,
            so the caller owns both its backpressure permit and the checkpoint-atomic
            transition from its retained ledger record to either a replacement prompt
            or the shortfall for the training step it was stamped for.

        Raises:
            RolloutRedispatchExhausted: The infra budget ran out and the fleet has not
                committed anything since ``max_consecutive_dropped_prompts`` drops ago.
