# ...and the same mid-refit kill on the RESHARD transport, which is a different abort.
#
# The two are not interchangeable. The collective path aborts one communicator; reshard
# holds TWO families -- the per-PP-stage bulk groups and the shared model_update_group --
# and a hang can be in either, so the watchdog is handed both and the rebuild has to
# regenerate the refit plan as well as the communicators. Nothing about that is exercised
# by the step-boundary variant above, which recovers between refits and never aborts.
#
# What this does NOT cover: the reshard ABORT. A killed actor produces ActorDiedError
# within milliseconds, so this recovers off the actor-death path and the deadline is never
# reached -- job 6405953 passed it with RefitAborted appearing zero times. Only the frozen
# reshard variant below makes a reshard refit actually abort.

# The only variant that reaches the refit watchdog. The two above kill the victim, and a
# killed actor produces ActorDiedError within milliseconds -- which recovers the run off
# the pre-existing actor-death path and leaves the deadline unexercised. Job 6405953
# passed both with RefitAborted appearing zero times.
#
# Freezing the victim with SIGSTOP instead leaves Ray seeing a healthy actor that has
# simply stopped participating, which is the case the abort exists for and the one its
# error message names. This variant asserts RefitAborted actually appears, so it cannot
# quietly degrade into testing the same path as the two above.
#
# It asserts the abort only, not recovery, and a NON-ZERO exit is its pass. A frozen rank
# never becomes absent -- measured on 4xGB200 it reaches SUSPECT and stops there -- so the
# reconcile correctly refuses to rebuild over a fleet that still holds a silent rank. The
# gain being pinned is that the run ends attributably in seconds rather than wedging in
# NCCL forever; actor-death-and-recover is what the two killed variants above cover, which
# is a different route -- they never reach the deadline at all.

# The reshard counterpart, and the fourth corner of {collective, nccl_reshard} x {kill,
# freeze}. The other three were registered; this one was not, and it is the only one that
# makes a RESHARD refit abort -- freezing is the only way to reach the deadline, since with
# SIGKILL ActorDiedError always wins the race.
#
# It is the variant that exercises two fixes nothing else reaches. The reshard bulk path
# never calls StatelessProcessGroup.broadcast, so before the translation in
# RefitAbortWatchdog.__exit__ an abort here escaped as an AttributeError and _sync_weights
# missed it. And this is the path that splits the parent communicator into per-replica
# children, which the parent's abort does not reach on its own.
#
# Unlike its packed-broadcast twin above, this one asserts a bounded ATTRIBUTABLE FAILURE,
# not survival. The bulk abort goes through sync_stream_within, which orphans kernels on the
# trainers' streams -- and aborting a communicator does not retire them, so the CUDA context
# cannot be trusted afterwards and the run is expected to end. Jobs 6521181 and 6523731
# measured both halves of that: the trainers wedge in init_nccl_communicator behind their own
# half-aborted communicator, and killing the frozen victim first changes nothing, because the
# orphaned work is local. See design_vllm_fault_tolerance.md section 8.5.7.
