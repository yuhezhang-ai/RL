"""The NeMo-RL-owned router that fronts the vLLM fleet for the NeMo-Gym path.

Gym picks a policy endpoint by static round-robin over a list fixed at process start,
never fails over, and retries a refused connection in an uncapped loop with no HTTP
timeout. Handing it one NeMo-RL-owned URL moves the routing decision here, next to the
fleet health that knows which shards are serving -- without changing Gym.

Most of these run a real aiohttp server against real backends. A proxy is precisely the
component that unit fakes flatter: header handling, streaming and status propagation only
misbehave over an actual socket.
